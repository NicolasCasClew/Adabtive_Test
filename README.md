# Coding test

This is a coding test I did as part of my internship interview with the company [Adabtive](https://adabtive.nl/)

## Functionality

I simulate the distance keeping systems insite a self driving car, keeping a safe distance from the car in front of me based on speed.


The speed of the other car is not known and its stored in a separate file
